## Summary
Our goal is to create an interactive Flask web application that helps users explore and visualize Spotify song trends from 2000â€“2019 using data analysis and rich, dynamic visualizations. Using D3.js, we will craft interactive data visualizations that reveal relationships between musical features like danceability, energy, popularity, tempo, and more.
